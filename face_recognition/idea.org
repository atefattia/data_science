* Task
Given an image of a person the algorithm should tell which celebrity looks alike.

* Dataset
[[http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/][Labeled Faces in the Wild]]

- 13233 images
- 5749 people
- 1680 people with two or more images

** others
http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html

https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/
- consists of 20k+ face images in the wild (only single face in one image)
- provides the correspondingly aligned and cropped faces
- provides the corresponding landmarks (68 points)
- images are labelled by age, gender, and ethnicity


* GAN for feature extraction
Can we train a GAN to map the images of the celebrities into a latent space in
which we hopefully have values that represent e.g. hair length, hair color or
face shape. It might not even be necessary to train this GAN since there should
exist pre-trained GANs train on human faces.

I know that GAN are normally used to generate new Images from a random
seed. But this question [0] refers to papers that explain how to use
GANs or more specific the discriminator of the GAN pair to obtain a
latent space representation [1][2].

This latent features can be computed for a new image and be compared to
the latent values the known celebrities. I think this will be the hard
part but maybe a NN can learn the mapping from face latent space to
celebrity more easily with the provided data. Or non neural clustering
or kNN approach might also work.
